**Introducing Laro - Your AI-Powered Recipe Companion**

Tired of scattered bookmarks, forgotten ingredients going bad, and the eternal "what's for dinner?" question? Meet **Laro** - a recipe manager built for home cooks who want to take control of their kitchen.

**What can Laro do?**

- **AI Recipe Import** - Paste any recipe URL and our AI extracts everything automatically. No more copy-pasting ingredients one by one.
- **Pantry Tracking** - Know what's in your fridge, get expiry alerts, and find recipes that use what you already have.
- **Meal Planning** - Drag-and-drop weekly planner. Let AI suggest meals based on your preferences and pantry.
- **Smart Shopping Lists** - Auto-generated from your meal plan, grouped by store aisle.
- **Cooking Mode** - Full-screen step-by-step guidance with built-in timers and an AI assistant to answer questions while you cook.

**Self-hosted or Cloud - Your choice**

- Want full control? Self-host with Docker in minutes. Your data stays on your server.
- Prefer convenience? Use our cloud version at **laro.food** - no setup required.
